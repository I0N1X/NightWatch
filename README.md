# NightWatch
NightWatch - GovHack 2017 project

Project Nightwatch is a new and innovative app designed and created by Yasas Kulatunga, William Peterswald, Chamindu Dayajeewa and Arjun Sharma. This project aims to make it easier for members of the community to know and be alert to potential dangers within the areas which are potentially risky. This product will provide the user with information about the area which they are in and about what potential dangers and past criminal acts committed within that area. By using crime data provided by the ACT Government we can collate and gather the most committed and common crimes done in an area and create an ordered list regarding the crimes committed. Overall our hope for this project is to inform and alert the community in Canberra so that they can be better prepared and be more vigilant in risky areas.
